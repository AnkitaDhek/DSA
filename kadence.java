//APPROACH 3 :KADENCE ALGORITHM
/*(It is the most optimized approach with a TC of O(n))

it basically says whereever we get current sum -ve while transversing  the array then intialize it with 0;
The algorithm wonâ€™t work if all elements of array are negative. We will make small changes to algorithm to make it
 work for negative numbers for too.
